    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The sandwich, as we know it today, was popularized in 1762 by John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich, in England. He requested a meal of cold meat placed between two slices of bread so he could eat without interrupting his gambling. This simple yet practical idea quickly gained popularity among England's gentry and later spread globally. However, the concept of placing food between bread has ancient roots, with similar practices observed in Mediterranean and Jewish traditions. Over time, the sandwich evolved into a versatile dish with countless variations, from simple meat fillings to elaborate creations featuring diverse ingredients.</p>
