    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>An omelet is a versatile and quick-to-make dish made by whisking eggs and cooking them in a skillet or frying pan. It is often folded over a variety of fillings, such as cheese, vegetables (like onions, bell peppers, or mushrooms), meats (like ham or bacon), or herbs. Omelets can be customized to suit individual tastes and are enjoyed worldwide as a breakfast, brunch, or even dinner option. The texture can range from soft and fluffy to thin and crisp, depending on the cooking method and regional variations.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs (2-3 Large eggs)</li>
        <li>Butter or oil</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare Ingredients: Whisk 2–3 eggs in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper. Chop any desired fillings (e.g., vegetables, cheese, or cooked meats).</li>
        <li>Heat the Pan: Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of butter or oil. Let it melt and coat the pan evenly.</li>
        <li>Cook the Eggs: Pour the whisked eggs into the skillet. Tilt the pan to spread the eggs evenly across the surface.</li>
        <li>Add Fillings: Once the eggs start to set but are still slightly runny on top, add your desired fillings (e.g., cheese, vegetables, or meats) to one half of the omelet.</li>
        <li>Fold the Omelet: Use a spatula to gently fold the other half of the omelet over the fillings.</li>
        <li>Cook Through: Let it cook for another 1–2 minutes until the eggs are fully set and the cheese (if used) is melted.</li>
        <li>Serve: Slide the omelet onto a plate and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>ENJOY!</h3>
